# RobotArm
This repository contains arduino and c# codes for my self-designed and self-build robot arm
It's compatible with most arduino based robotarms
Functions:
- Send 3D positon to the robotarm
- Send individual angles to the arm
- Macro maker is under development 

The arduino code contains some built in movements (waveing, highfive etc)
